## Introduction
Welcome to **Snake.io Game**! This project is a modern twist on the classic Snake game built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Designed by **blobbyofficial**, this game is now part of the [Classic Games Hub](https://blobbyofficial.github.io/classic-games-hub/). Whether you're playing on desktop or mobile, enjoy the nostalgic gameplay with smooth animations and intuitive controls. 😎

This README provides a deep dive into the project—from its folder structure to development insights and future plans.

---

## Features
- **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy beautifully interpolated movement between grid cells that makes the snake glide rather than jump.
- **Mobile-Friendly Controls**: Use swipe gestures on mobile devices to control the snake, while desktop players can rely on arrow keys or WASD.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is built to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **High Score Tracking**: Your best score is saved locally so you can always try to beat your previous record.
- **Simple & Intuitive UI**: Minimalistic design with a retro neon vibe.
- **Dynamic Grid Display**: A clear grid is drawn on the canvas to emphasize the classic look.
- **Robust Collision Detection**: The game ends when you collide with the wall or your own body.
- **Two-Page Experience**: A polished start screen (index.html) and a game screen (game.html) for a smooth user experience.

And much, much more... 🚀🔥

---

## How to Play
1. **Start Screen**: Open the start page and press "Play" to begin.
2. **Desktop Controls**: Use arrow keys or WASD to direct the snake.
3. **Mobile Controls**: Swipe in the direction you want the snake to go.
4. **Objective**: Eat the red food to grow longer and score points.
5. **Game Over**: Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail. When the game ends, you can press the "Back" button to return to the start screen.

**Tip:** Try to beat your own high score and challenge your friends to do the same! 😄

## Development & Technologies
Snake.io Game was built using:

- HTML5: For semantic, accessible markup.
- CSS3: For styling, layout, and responsive design.
- Vanilla JavaScript: For game logic, animations, and input handling.
- localStorage: For persisting high scores across sessions.

**Tools Used:**
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred code editor)
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting and collaboration
- Browser developer tools for debugging

The project was developed with a focus on performance, simplicity, and a retro aesthetic that honors classic arcade games.

## Behind the Scenes
The journey of creating Snake.io Game began as a small experiment. Over time, the project evolved through several iterations:

- **Prototype Phase**: A basic implementation of snake movement and collision detection.
- **Beta Phase**: Introduced smooth animations and refined grid-based movement.
- **Final Release**: Added mobile swipe controls, a dedicated start screen, high score tracking, and polished UI elements.

**Challenges Overcome:**
- Smooth Animations: Achieved using interpolation techniques to make movement seamless.
- Cross-Platform Input: Integrating keyboard and touch/swipe controls.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring that the game looks great on all devices.
- Performance Optimization: Balancing visual effects with smooth gameplay even on lower-end devices.

Every bug and feature request was a learning experience that shaped the final product.

## Extended Details
**Technical Architecture**  
The Snake.io Game project is structured to be lightweight, modular, and easily extendable. Key components include:

- HTML: Markup for two main pages (start and game).
- CSS: A unified stylesheet (style.css) that adapts to multiple devices.
- JavaScript: Handles game logic, animation, input (keyboard and touch), collision detection, and high score management.
- localStorage: Used to store high scores persistently.

**Detailed Component Interaction**  
- Game Loop: The game loop uses requestAnimationFrame to render frames and interpolate movement between grid cells, resulting in smooth animations.
- Input Handling: Both keyboard and swipe gestures are supported.
- Collision Logic: The collision detection checks for wall collisions as well as self-collisions, ending the game if either occurs.
- Animation Interpolation: A progress variable is used to interpolate between fixed grid positions, making transitions smoother.

**Design Philosophy**  
- Minimalism: The game design is kept simple and clean to provide an uncluttered, enjoyable gaming experience.
- Responsiveness: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring that both desktop and mobile users have a great experience.
- Modularity: The code is structured to be modular and easy to maintain. Separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allow for scalable growth and feature additions.
- User Engagement: Features like high score tracking and responsive controls are designed to keep players engaged and encourage repeat play.
